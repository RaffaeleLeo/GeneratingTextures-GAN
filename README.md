# TextureSynthesisProject

A side project I made while learning about GAN models. A detailed explination can be seen in the short paper.

This model is able to take in an image such as the one below:

![Copy of Copy of Copy of forest_texture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0f9bb40-d092-41ab-9631-d083018883e8)

And output a texture based off of the original image however large the user wants:

![final_big_texture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acffa665-9377-4031-bdaf-74d55a9315e3)
